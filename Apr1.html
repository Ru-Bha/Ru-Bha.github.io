    <p class="card-desc">Sweetie,<br> If you wonder just how much <br>I love you, wonder no more. <br>You are the sun in my sky, <br>the river that runs through my soul, <br>and the very air I breathe. <br>Before I met you, I didn't believe<br> it was possible to love someone so deeply<br> and completely, but you have given <br>me faith that true love really does <br>exist because I share it with you.</p>

    <p class="card-desc">Dear Heart,<br>
      Being apart from you is more difficult than I ever imagined. I see reminders of you everywhere I look, and they make me ache to be near you again.
      I love you with all my heart. I cherish every moment we spend together, and I love you even more in the moments when we are apart. Tonight as I write this letter, itâ€™s like you are right here with me. I feel your hand on my shoulder, your fingers in my hair, and the soft breath of your kiss on my cheek. I miss you, darling. Come home soon.</p>

      You are my inspiration in life and the most important thing to me. When I think of you, I cannot imagine a future without you. You are my soulmate, and I know deep in my heart we are meant to be. Without you, my world would feel meaningless. Thank you for filling my life with purpose.</p>
