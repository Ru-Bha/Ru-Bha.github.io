        I love you. I love you. I love you. I can never say those three words enough and unfortunately I feel like you haven’t heard them at all lately. I’m sorry about that. I’ve been so overwhelmed with work that I haven’t had the time to give you much attention, but that will change soon. You know why? Because I love you. I love you. I love you.</p>

        I want to be there for you when you need someone. I’ve loved you for a while, and I’m not tired. The thought of you is always on my mind, and it’s going nowhere.
        I cross my heart to love you when no one does and make you happy when the whole world is sad. I’m committed to love you and be the one who dries your tears. Keeping up with all those promises won’t be easy, but nothing is easy in life. I’m giving away myself to love you forever. I will give you the peace you deserve. I love you, baby. I will keep saying it forever.</p>

        I haven’t said this in a while but you are the most attractive man I have ever known. I cannot believe you are mine. You make me laugh harder than anyone else. You aren’t perfect, not even close (hah), but you are certainly perfect for me. I wouldn’t change a single thing about you. Not a hair on your head.</p>

        I love you beyond words, and I’m thankful for the connection we share. I’m falling in love with you with the passing of the day. If you know how special you are, you will be excited like me.
        Your presence leaves me breathless because you sweep me off my feet. I can’t say much, but I know that you’re everything good in my life. It’s like a dream that you are mine, and I can’t appreciate God enough. When I am with you, I am in control of the world, and I can draw a portrait of an angel by looking at you. I’ll always be with you and offer you a warm embrace when you need one. I love you, babe.</p>
