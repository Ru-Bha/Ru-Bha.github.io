        When I first saw you, I longed for your love. Since then I can’t stop thinking about you. I don’t know what I will do without you. You are the dearest person in my life. I love you so much.
        You being in my life has made me accomplish great things in life. All my dreams have come true. I can’t believe you are all mine. I will do anything for you. Just say it, my love.
        I treasure you so much as you are the sweetest, caring, and kindest Hubby that a girl could ever want. I love you</p>

        I love us. We’re the cutest. I know that sounds braggy, but I mean it when I say that I think we make the perfect couple. We understand each other. We listen to each other. We inspire each other to become stronger with each passing day. Happy anniversary. I cannot wait to spend another year alongside you, because there is no place I would rather be. You’re stuck with me. You better remember that!</p>

        You give me strength when I feel weak. I know you are always there to support me, just like I will always be there for you. Knowing you have my back and I have yours fills me with joy and love. I’m so thankful for our relationship and how it has helped me get back on my feet.</p>

    <p class="card-desc">To my everything,<br>
        I hate being apart from you, but our long distance love gives me something to look forward to each and every day. I keep counting down the moments until I get to feel your arms wrapped around me again, until I get to fall asleep to the sound of your soft breathing, until I get to hear your laugh the second it leaves your lips instead of through the delay of the phone. I love you and I miss you — but the pain of not seeing you is worth it. You are worth it. I would wait a lifetime for you.</p>
